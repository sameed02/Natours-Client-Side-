------------------------ Notes ------------------------

1. Remember that the H one is the single most important heading on the page which is important for Google or for any other search engine to figure out what our webpage is all about. And so it's important that we basically put the title of our webpage in there. Now we could only just put outdoors in there, so make this the H one, and then for example, make an H two here for the secondary header, and put this is where life happens in there. But that's not what we want, because we don't want our primary text or title of the website to say just outdoors. We want all of this text. And so we must somehow divide this text. So, what are we going to do? We are going to use this span element. And this span element is perfect for this because remember that a span is simply to style some text different. And so we can just put two span elements in here, one for each part. One for the top, and one for the bottom. So span, class heading, primary, main. And then the same for the part on the bottom.
